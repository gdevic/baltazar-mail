# Microsoft Edge Add-ons: submission kit

Everything to paste into Partner Center for Baltazar Mail. Upload `baltazar-mail-<version>-store.zip` from GitHub Releases as the package: the same files as the release ZIP, with `manifest.json` at the top level as the store requires. Images are in this folder; `node tools/screenshots.js --store` regenerates them.

## Privacy

Single purpose description:

> Baltazar Mail is an alternative reading and writing interface for the user's own Yahoo Mail account. It shows the user's folders and messages, previews attachments, and sends mail, using the Yahoo sign-in the user already has in this browser.

Permission justifications:

- `storage`: Keeps the user's settings (layout, theme and contrast, sizes, fonts, intervals) and the time of the last release check on this computer, and, for the browser session only, the Yahoo session values that Yahoo's own web page uses, so the extension does not reload Yahoo's page for every request, and a message being printed, until the print page has read it.
- `declarativeNetRequest`: Yahoo's mail servers accept requests only when they come from mail.yahoo.com. One rule, registered by the extension at start-up and shipped in its code, sets the Origin and Referer headers to https://mail.yahoo.com on the extension's own requests to Yahoo's mail hosts. The rule is limited to requests the extension itself initiates (initiatorDomains is the extension's own ID), to XHR/fetch requests only, and to mail.yahoo.com and its subdomains. It changes nothing on any web page the user visits.
- Host permission `https://mail.yahoo.com/*`: All mailbox operations (folders, message lists, search, reading, moving, deleting, drafts and sending) go to Yahoo's mail API on this host, with the user's existing Yahoo sign-in.
- Host permission `https://*.mail.yahoo.com/*`: Yahoo serves message source (used to show attachments), attachment thumbnails and images embedded in messages from subdomains of mail.yahoo.com (apis.mail.yahoo.com, cloud-apis.mail.yahoo.com).

Remote code: No, I am not using remote code. All code ships in the package; the Content Security Policy allows scripts only from the extension itself.

Data usage, what the extension handles (recommended declarations; all of it stays on the user's computer or goes only to Yahoo):

- Personal communications: email messages and attachments, fetched from Yahoo when the user opens them and shown on screen; not stored.
- Personally identifiable information: names and email addresses from the user's own Inbox and Sent headers, kept in a local address book for suggestions while writing.
- Authentication information: the Yahoo session values Yahoo's own web page uses, kept in the browser's session storage and cleared when the browser closes.

Certify: data is not sold, not used for purposes unrelated to the single purpose, and not used for creditworthiness or lending. No analytics, telemetry or advertising.

## Store listing (English)

The description names features in sentences, not lists: the Chrome Web Store rejects runs of format or product names as keyword spam.

Extension name: Baltazar Mail (from the manifest)

Short description (from the manifest): A fast, ad-free client for Yahoo Mail that reuses your existing Yahoo sign-in. Not affiliated with Yahoo.

Description:

> Baltazar Mail is a fast, clean, ad-free way to read and write your Yahoo Mail. It opens in its own tab and uses the Yahoo sign-in you already have in the browser, so there is nothing to set up: sign in to mail.yahoo.com once, then click the Baltazar Mail button.
>
> Reading: a three-column or stacked layout with resizable panes, sixteen light and dark palettes in different hues with a contrast slider, an adjustable text size, and a dark reading pane that darkens messages to match while keeping their hues and leaving images untouched. A Starred view collects flagged mail from every folder.
>
> Mailbox: mark messages read or unread, star, archive, move, delete or report them as spam, one at a time or as a selection, with multi-level undo and redo.
>
> Search: limited to the open folder and its subfolders, with matches elsewhere listed below, and simple operators to narrow it down.
>
> Writing: new messages, replies, and forwards that keep the original's attachments, rich or plain text, inline images, automatic drafts and undo-send. Address suggestions come from your own Inbox and Sent, with automated senders left out.
>
> Attachments open in place: documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images and media are previewed without downloading; documents are read inside an isolated sandbox with no access to your session.
>
> Privacy: no server, no analytics, no ads. Your mail goes only between your browser and Yahoo. The source code is public at github.com/gdevic/baltazar-mail.
>
> Baltazar Mail is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by or sponsored by Yahoo. Yahoo and Yahoo Mail are trademarks of their owner.

## Notes for certification

> No test account is included. Baltazar Mail works with any Yahoo Mail account, and the reviewer's own or any existing test account can be used. A shared account cannot be provided reliably: Yahoo requires every new account to be verified with a personal mobile number (virtual numbers are rejected), and it challenges sign-ins from an unfamiliar computer with a code sent to that phone, so a reviewer could be locked out of a shared account. If access is still needed, please ask through Partner Center and it will be arranged promptly.
>
> To test: in the same browser profile, sign in to https://mail.yahoo.com with any Yahoo account, then click the Baltazar Mail toolbar button. The extension opens its own tab with the mailbox. Things to try: open a folder and a message, search (the ? next to the search box explains the syntax), open an attachment from the strip under a message, write a message to yourself with New message, and open Settings with the gear button. Nothing is changed in the account unless the reviewer moves, deletes or sends mail.
>
> How it works: the extension calls the same web API that Yahoo's own mail page uses, with the user's existing Yahoo sign-in; it never sees or stores the password. Yahoo's servers accept those calls only when they come from mail.yahoo.com, so a single declarativeNetRequest session rule sets Origin and Referer to https://mail.yahoo.com, limited to requests initiated by this extension (initiatorDomains), XHR/fetch only, on mail.yahoo.com and its subdomains.
>
> No remote code. No analytics or third-party services: an install from this store talks only to Yahoo. (The GitHub release build, installed with Load unpacked, also checks GitHub once a day for a newer version; that check is switched off for store installs.)
>
> Attachments are parsed by bundled open-source libraries (PDF.js, docx-preview, SheetJS, JSZip, DOMPurify) inside a manifest sandbox page with an opaque origin and no extension APIs. Source, security notes and a privacy policy: https://github.com/gdevic/baltazar-mail
